      "Where it all started. This lab brings back great memories that I wish to
      revisit. I had no idea what was in store for me. I remember vividly that
      all of these Youtube videos, coursera lectures, c# books for beginners
      were all telling me that I was already becoming a programmer simply by
      telling me to write "Hello World". I can't tell if this a funny joke or
      not."

      "This was the lab that made me think of the scene from the Matrix.
        <P>  Morpheus : This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.
            You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and
            believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in
            Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes."  </P>
     
      <p>   Morpheus : [to Neo who is choosing the red pill] 
        Remember... all I'm offering is the
        truth. Nothing more.</p>
     
        <p>  Yup... their was no going back from this. First week conditional statements,
            loops, declaring variables, cool. What the hell is a GitHub....? 
            Couple weeks in you're learning collections and catching errors
            with exceptions and some basic Object Orientation Program (OOP).
            I've met my match. I still felt uncomfortable with creating a 
            basic method and now they want me to call a method outside of a class?
            After some trial and error I felt like my brain made its fifteenth
            "A-HA" moment." </p>

    <h2>Shopping List Group Project</h2>

</a>





    <p>
     Here I am. My first group project. Nervous. Excited. Confused. 
     Somewhat optimistic about the whole process. This was going to be
     the moment that you were going to be tested on a lot of the topics
     that we've covered in the past. Addding in another element,
     teamwork. 
     
     <p>We've all had good and bad experiences when it comes
        to group projects in the past. Some team members are quiet, some 
        loud. Some are hard working, some nothing. However, not to get all
        poetic with you, but this is where chemistry is made with people.
        You work with what you got and you move on. My partners 
        Kris and Mara were pleasant to be around. </p>
    

        <p> Kris was a monster machine. Making sure no one could break our code.
            And I mean no one. Well, I think his daughter did break it once..?
            </p>
     
     <p>      Mara, the logical killer. The brains of the operations. Their was
        not one syntax error she couldn't solve.  </p>
  
     <p>     Me? What did I do? I took the glory and ran with it.</p>
